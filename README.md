I’m a Computer Science & Engineering student at the University of Iowa (since 2023) with a strong interest in systems, embedded development, and hands-on engineering. I grew up tinkering with anything I could get my hands on, which led me from mechanical and robotics interests into computer engineering, where I found my passion in software and hardware integration.

In my free time, I run personal servers built from repurposed Dell Optiplex machines running Arch Linux, Windows, and headless Ubuntu setups. After taking Embedded Systems, I also began developing microcontroller projects and designing custom PCBs for IoT applications in everyday life.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy learning new things and immediately putting them into practice. I’m a dog person (cats are chill though), enjoy sandbox games like Teardown and Noita, and I’m a big movie fan. Current favorites, in order:
